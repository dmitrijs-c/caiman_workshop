    "1) Apply the NoRMCorre (nonrigid motion correction) algorithm for motion correction.\n",
    "2) Apply the constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) source separation algorithm to extract an initial estimate of neuronal spatial footprint and calcium traces.  \n",
    "3) Apply quality control metrics to evaluate the initial estimates, and narrow down to the final set of estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNMF algorithm is best for data with relatively low background noise, like most two-photon data and *some* one photon data (e.g., certain light sheet data). For a demo analysis pipeline of a one-photon microendoscopic data set see `demo_pipeline_cnmfE.ipynb`."

    "If you hit memory issues later, there are a few things you can do. First, you may want to lower the number of processors you are using. Each processor uses more RAM, and on a workstation with many processors, you can sometimes get better performance by reducing <em>num_processors_to_use</em>.The best way to determine the optimal number is by trial and error. When you set <em>num_processors_to_use</em> variable to <em>None</em>, it defaults to <i>one</i> less than the total number of CPU cores available (the reason we don't automatically set it to the total number of cores is because in practice this typically leads to worse performance).\n",

While you can sometimes get away with less, we recommend a *bare minimum* level of 16GB of RAM, but more is better. 32GB RAM is acceptable, 64GB or more is best. Obviously, this will depend on the size of your data sets. \n",

This uses much less memory than the offline approach. The demo notebook for OnACID is found in <a href=\"./demo_OnACID_mesoscope.ipynb\">demo_OnACID_mesoscope.ipynb</a>.
